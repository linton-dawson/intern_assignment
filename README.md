## The following project :-
* Verifies user login and password
* Records a 10-second video through webcam
* Extracts red channel from frames
* Applies Gaussian Blur to above frames
* Saves above videos in folder "filter_vids" (creates in build directory)
* Lists all videos currently in above directory


(Visual Studio may have the problem of having to manually link the stdc++fs library (LNK1104 error).)
